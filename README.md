## Reflection ✨
We started by discussing potential project ideas that we could complete in less than a week and shared our thoughts. With limited time, we quickly made a decision and began creating a framework to prioritize tasks and organize our work. We managed our time effectively by sharing daily updates via messages and holding one or two meetings each week. Through this experience, I learned that coding is crucial, but communication plays an equally important role in organizing time, reducing task duplication, tracking progress, and supporting each other.
